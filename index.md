# Alessandro Dell'Orto

I took my Master degree in Physiscs of Complex Systems at University of Torino in July 2020. During these years I developed hard skills in Machine Learning, Game and Network Theory and Numerical Methods. My master thesis focused on modelling evolutionary games on graphs and simulating them numerically. Now I am an Application Developer at Accenture.

## Projects


### SIR and TSIR model on Covid19 data (in team) [ongoing] (june 2021)

Using SIR and TSIR model to predict covid19 diffusion.

### Kaggle Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets (april 2021)

The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). In this competition, i must predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. Here I used:
1. Feature Importance & RFECV (recursive features elimination with cross validation)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes models (Gaussian, Multinomial, Complement)
4. CountVectorizer
5. Stemming & Lemming

### Kaggle Digit Recognizer (march 2021)

In this competition, my goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 
I used:
 1. CNN
 2. Tensorflow

### Kaggle House Pricing (January 2021)

In this challenge I had to predict the price of the house/flat in Moscow given hundreds of features. I had the occasion to "fight" with features and so developed some skills on:
  1. Features Reduction/Selection (variancethresold, selectkbest, selectfrommodel, selectpercentile)
  2. Features Correlation (Spearman and Pearson Correlation Matrix)

### Kaggle Titanic (in team) (december 2020)

In this challenge, the goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). Here, I and my team focused on developing our skills and knowledge on data preprocessing using sklearn and pandas, particularly:
  1. Data imputation
  2. Feature Extraction
  3. Rescaling and Normalizing Data
  4. One hot Encoding
  5. Ensemble Learning (boosting)
Rank: Top 10%

### Kaggle Reddit (April 2020)

The goal of this competition is to predict the gender of these users using their messages and their subscription to the subreddits.
In this work I had the opportunity to:
  1. develope my knowledge on Natural Language Processing
  2. use nltk library
  3. study and use Naive Bayes Methods
  4. study and use ensemble learning (bagging)
